This is an export of [PhotoView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView) to Xamarin android platform 

![PhotoView](https://raw.github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView/master/header_graphic.png)

PhotoView aims to help produce an easily usable implementation of a zooming Android ImageView. It is currently being used in [photup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.senab.photup).

## Features
- Out of the box zooming, using multi-touch and double-tap.
- Scrolling, with smooth scrolling fling.
- Works perfectly when using used in a scrolling parent (such as ViewPager).
- Allows the application to be notified when the displayed Matrix has changed. Useful for when you need to update your UI based on the current zoom/scroll position.
- Allows the application to be notified when the user taps on the Photo.


## Sample Usage
There is a [sample](https://github.com/samerzmd/Xamarin-Android-Photo-Viewer/blob/master/XamarinAndroidPhotoViewer/MainActivity.cs) provided which shows how to use the library in a more advanced way, but for completeness here is all that is required to get PhotoView working:

``` C#
ImageView mImageView;
PhotoViewAttacher mAttacher;

protected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle)
		{
			base.OnCreate (bundle);

			// Set our view from the "main" layout resource
			SetContentView (Resource.Layout.Main);
			PhotoView mImageView = FindViewById<PhotoView>(Resource.Id.iv_photo);

			Drawable bitmap = Resources.GetDrawable(Resource.Drawable.wallpaper);
			mImageView.SetImageDrawable(bitmap);

			// The MAGIC happens here!
			mAttacher = new PhotoViewAttacher(mImageView);
			
		}


// If you later call mImageView.SetImageDrawable/SetImageBitmap/SetImageResource/etc then you just need to call
mAttacher.Update();
```
